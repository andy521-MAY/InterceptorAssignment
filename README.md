# InterceptorAssignment
InterceptorAssignment, the Movie Rental system based on Chapter 1 from Fowler’s Refactoring text 

the Movie Rental system was refactored and I applied 2 interceptors here which are the DiscountInterceptor and LoggingInterceptor
For the DiscountInterceptor， I Apply 10% discount for customers with more than 2 rentals.
For the LoggingInterceptor, I just output the customer's name before the customer statement.

I used the RentalStatementTest to test the actual statement and expectStatement. And it is successful.
